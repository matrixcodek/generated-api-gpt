Alright, let's tackle this in steps:

1. Create an API endpoint named `form` which can accept 0 to 4 parameters.
2. Create a controller that sends a request to another API, i.e., `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`.

1. **API Endpoint for Form:**

Let's create the `FormController` which contains the `form` endpoint:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class FormController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("form")]
    public IActionResult Form(string param1 = null, int? param2 = null, string param3 = null, string param4 = null)
    {
        return Ok(new 
        {
            param1,
            param2,
            param3,
            param4
        });
    }
}
```

Here, we're making use of the default parameter values to accept 0 to 4 parameters.

2. **Controller to make requests to another API:**

We need to create a controller to make a GET request to `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`. For this, you can utilize `HttpClient`.

First, remember to register `HttpClient` in the `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpClient();
    // ... other services
}
```

Next, create the `CountriesController`:

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class CountriesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public CountriesController(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
    }

    [HttpGet("all")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetAllCountries()
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all");

        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            return Ok(content);
        }

        return BadRequest($"Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
    }
}
```

This controller has a method `GetAllCountries` that sends a GET request to the specified URL and returns the results.

Now, when you run your application, you can call the `/api/form` endpoint with the desired parameters, and the `/api/countries/all` endpoint to get a list of all countries. Make sure to have necessary error handling and exception handling in place, and adjust the API endpoints as per your requirements.
